# Recent US Bird Observations
This app allows users to access recent bird observation data by US state along with a recording and image of the bird species.

Live version: https://kimberlyc222.github.io/RecentUSBirdObservations/

This app utilizes three APIs to display recent observation data, by US state, with an image of the type of bird and a sample recording.
Users first select a US state and submit the form to reveal results for the particular state.  Each page of results displays five result items.
Each result item includes basic observation data, an image of the bird and a sample recording.  When an image is unable to load, a generic image of 
a bird silhouette is displayed as a placeholder.  The app is limited in the number of image queries that can be made to the Bing image API.
